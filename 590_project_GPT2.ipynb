The city reprised this role for the Live 8 concert, bringing some 700,000 people to the Ben Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005. Philadelphia is home to the world-renowned Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale, which has performed its music all over the world. Dr. Robert G. Hamilton, founder of the choir, is a notable native Philadelphian. The Philly Pops is another famous Philadelphia music group. The city has played a major role in the development and support of American rock music and rap music.

A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes are scattered throughout the city, much of the housing is from the early 20th century or older. The great age of the homes has created numerous problems, including blight and vacant lots in many parts of the city, while other neighborhoods such as Society Hill, which has the largest concentration of 18th-century architecture in the United States, have been rehabilitated and gentrified.\n","[QUESTION]:Name a type of row house in the city?\n","[ANSWER]:Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia\n","[QUESTION]:What are row houses called outside of Philadelphia?\n","[ANSWER]:Philadelphia rows\n","[QUESTION]:What is the dominant type of house in Philadelphia?\n","[ANSWER]:row house\n","[QUESTION]:How old is most of the housing in Philadelphia?\n","[ANSWER]:early 20th century or older\n","[QUESTION]:Which neighborhood has the oldest housing in America?\n","[ANSWER]:Society Hill\n","<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>\n","[CONTEXT]: By the 20th century, Philadelphia had become known as \"corrupt and contented\", with a complacent population and an entrenched Republican political machine.

The same right is still required, however, to be eligible to vote for one of the two seats available to a racial or ethnic minority; in 2008, an analysis found only 32 racial or ethnic minority seats.

For this reason, many plants often use some light to provide the light their roots require, for protection from direct light (dusk or dawn), or for promoting pollination of secondary metabolites in trees by the roots. These plants have special means of maintaining this light, which is essential to the health of these ecosystems. As they move away from the natural light, the plants continue to need some light.

As far back as the Mesozoic, trees were often used as ropes or to cover logs.[b] From the late Cambrian period up until the Cretaceous Period and throughout the Late Carboniferous, forests were the dominant source of light in trees and the sun was essential to all aspects of daily life. This changed with the onset of drought in the last Miocene Epoch, and trees found a greater need to use the sun.
